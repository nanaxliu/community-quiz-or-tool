This is a quiz that will tell you if the average Chinese parents will accept and be proud of you or not.

**Design Process**
I started by thinking about what I wanted to evoke with my quiz. I thought something humourous 
with a hint of truth would be interesting, so I brainstormed ideas for a quiz based off of those emotions.
That is how I came up with the question, "Would the average Chinese parents accpet and be proud of you?"

**Challenges Faced**
I think the most challenging part of this project was the javascript. I wasn't familiar with event
listeners or local storage, so getting the js to work was probably the most difficult part for me.

**Next Steps**
If I had more time, I think I would try to make the site look a little nicer. I don't think it looks
ugly, but it just looks a little empty and could benefit from some images or other design elements.
